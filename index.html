                <h3>Know the Hull Truth</h3>
               
                <div class="infoText">
                    <p>The hull is the main part of a boat â€” check it carefully. Inspect it for any defects, dents, gouges, holes (repaired or otherwise) and other irregularities, such as visible fiberglass repairs. Especially check below the water line, which can be damaged from banging into rocks, debris or other boats.
    
                    Older boats have wood transoms (the vertical section at the rear of the boat) that can rot internally. Excessive movement when lifting the motor up and down or forward and rear generally means a weak or broken transom. </p>

                <h3>More Important Stuff</h3>
               
                <div class="infoText">
                    <p>Do a thorough inspection of the deck. Take your time. Inspect for rot, cracks, dents, holes or soft spots. The deck should not feel mushy when you push down on it with your hands.
    
                        Signs of decay or plywood delamination may indicate hidden damage. Check the seats for excessive wear, mold and mildew. If the hull and deck are in good shape, carefully inspect the rest of the boat.</p>

                    <p>We organized the gear in the level of importance. The gear we think is the most important are first and the gear you can probably do without is at the bottom.
                        Make sure to follow any state regulations for what you should have on your boat and safety!.</p>
